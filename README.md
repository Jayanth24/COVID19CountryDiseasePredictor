## Project Proposal
### Introduction/Background
Corona-virus disease 2019[3] is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 and as of September 2020 has infected more than 31 million people worldwide. With six months past the day when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and the fear of a second wave buzzing, it becomes important to analyze the effectiveness different responses to the virus in order to ensure we are making the right decisions and polices moving forward.

### Problem Definition
Given the health and lock down data[2] available regarding COVID-19, predict the total number of cases a country is to experience over the duration of the pandemic.

### Methods


### Potential Results
Potential results include achieving a high accuracy predictive model for countries still facing the pandemic, allowing for the variation of the Government Stringency Index[1] to in order to understand how effective differing lock downs were, and developing a second model to predict GDP loss in order to find the happy medium between lives saved and GDP losses.

### Discussion
By having a model to predict total number of cases, one becomes able to isolate individual features, under the assumption of independent, so that analysis of government pandemic policies may better prepare the world for future infectious diseases.
